Settings Presets Blender Add-on

If you use Blender for differnt scenarios or have to change different settings often than this addon is for you. It also can help you with transfering your settings to another computer(Usefull if you have a havely custumized Blender Settup as I do).

Blender have application templates but they are not so handy to use and have some limitation. So here is my implementation of it

Features:

Saving current settings as a preset so you can apply it any time

Exporting your settings(current or alredy saved) to a .zip file(can also include addons)

Importing a preset from a .zip file

I tried to make the interface as intuitive as possible so i don't think it need an explanation on how it works.
